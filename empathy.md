A colleague experienced a family tragedy and went on leave, then called me very stressed about how her work was going to get done. My first instinct was to just tell her not to worry about it, but I could tell that wasn't going to be enough as she was quite fixated on this and seemed to have become somewhere she was redirecting her stress. So I made a plan to cover her workload (partly myself, partly by bringing others on board) and then talked through how we were going to do it with her. She seemed really reassured by this, and to stop fixating on work until she returned to the office.

This was absolutely worth it - aside from her being someone I liked experiencing a horrible situation, it was just the decent thing to do and within my capabilities. It wasn't too difficult but it did require some thought. I chose this example in particular partly because my first response, though generally caring, was not sufficiently empathetic and partly because it was a quite different reaction to that of most of my colleagues who focussed on direct emotional comfort. That's something I find very difficult, and I think this is a good example of how different people show empathy in different ways.
