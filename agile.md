My current role, while in a different industry, involves managing projects, and we deal with both conservatism (they sang that in Latin in England in the fifteenth century, it's unthinkable to change it!)/bureaucracy and have to be highly responsive to last minute change. As I don't work within a particular formalised framework like Agile, it's interesting to see how that responsiveness to change can be formalised. I am also interested in - and like - the involving of end users at every step rather than at the end, when there can be pressure to accept something sub-par if the alternative is waiting another two years (yes, I've been there!).

Based on the readings, I did find it hard to understand how it worked with fixed timeframes. The framework for clearing a backlog makes a lot of sense if the goal is "do as many things as possible", a little like the Pomodoro method might work for an individual, but seems less compatible with specific delivery dates.
