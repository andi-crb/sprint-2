In the "Principles of Universal Design" article, the first - and in particular the first part, "Design for the User" - seemed the most important as most (arguably all) of the others flowed on from it or were ways of achieving it.

I didn't disagree with any of them as such, except possibly the advice to "Use simple and natural dialogue" - I think this is a good starting point but if you know your audience other styles may be appropriate for them. However some principles were very context dependent and I could see them being easily misapplied. For example, "don't overwhelm the user by providing more information... than is necessary to perform the task" would look very different  on the tvtropes website, where users go specifically to be sucked into interesting but non-essential information compared to, for example, an instructional page on how to log into internet banking where users simply want to know how to perform the task and then stop reading.

The "ROI of User Experience" video was useful and presented a lot of new information, however I can't say that anything actively surprised me. I think the most important things to take on board from it are the false economy of not spending money in the area, and how much cheaper it is to fix a problem before deployment rather than after. I'm interested in learning more about testing/stakeholder consultation/etc and how to apply it to my web development work.
