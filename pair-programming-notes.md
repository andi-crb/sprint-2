As of yet, I haven't managed to meet up with anyone to try pair-programming. I'm going to do my best to do so asap, but scheduling is proving a problem - I'll update this file if I manage it this week.
I'm both keen to try pair programming and a little bit nervous. I can absolutely see the value of having more than one person working on code, as different people have different skillsets and knowledge. However my working style tends to be to work independently on technical or detail stuff, and collaboratively on planning and strategising. I tend towards introversion (albeit rather talkative introversion) and tend to need to intersperse solo and collaborative working, so am unsure how this will play out for me. 

Update, 21/11/2015: I tried an online pair programming session with a classmate (Gaynor Landmark) today. It was in general, easier than I expected - the main difficulty was working out how to connect/what software to use. As we were both new to pair programming, we worked on creating a very simple html document, `with us swapping the driver and navigator roles part way through. I found it useful that one person could look up something we weren't sure about while the other continued to focus on the code, and to have a second pair of eyes to spot mistakes, however it did go slowly and for it to be practical in an everyday sense we would need to significantly increase our speed - hopefully this comes with practice.
