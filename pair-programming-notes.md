As of yet, I haven't managed to meet up with anyone to try pair-programming. I'm going to do my best to do so asap, but scheduling is proving a problem - I'll update this file if I manage it this week.
I'm both keen to try pair programming and a little bit nervous. I can absolutely see the value of having more than one person working on code, as different people have different skillsets and knowledge. However my working style tends to be to work independently on technical or detail stuff, and collaboratively on planning and strategising. I tend towards introversion (albeit rather talkative introversion) and tend to need to intersperse solo and collaborative working, so am unsure how this will play out for me.
