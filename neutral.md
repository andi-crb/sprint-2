I agree with the article "Achieving Equity Through Gender-Neutral Language" as to the importance of using Gender-Neutral Language (though the idea that it in itself can be used to achieve equity is an obvious overstatement) and think most of its examples are sound. However it operates on the assumption that there are only two genders and while this is not an uncommon assumption, in an article on this subject it seemed a very pointed form of erasure. 

As an example, the advice "When addressing the class, use terminology that includes both women and men. Avoid such phrases as “you guys” or “ladies”" completely ignore the existence of anyone other than women or men and how language can also be used to specifically exclude them. A more inclusive version of this would be "When addressing the class, use terminology that includes all genders. Avoid such phrases as “you guys” or “ladies” or "ladies and gentlemen"."

I grew up using gender neutral language, especially for professions, so I generally don't need to make an effort (there are other stigmatising/exclusionary words I'm trying to eliminate from my vocabulary, however) except for having developed a bad habit of using "guys" on occasion. For that reason, I'm much more likely to notice when someone doesn't use gender neutral language than when they do.
