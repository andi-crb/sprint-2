Text that is not a link should not be underlined, as users strongly associate underlining with links.

Unvisited links should be a brighter and more saturated colour than visited links, but of a similar hue (eg different shades of blue). The differences should be visible to colour blind users - sigificant differences in the levels of brightness can be used for this.

A percieved affordance is something about an object which the user can come to associate with its purpose. For example, the shape and colour of a stop sign makes its meaning recognisable to many people even without the text, and despite there being nothing inherent in otagonal shapes that indicates one should stop. In this context, the user strongly associates underlining of text with links.

Underlining can be eliminated in clearly indicated navigational menus and other lists of links, however this should not be done if you use reds or greens for these links (creates issues for colour blind users) or if you expect a high number of users with low vision.

Blue text should only be used for links, as users strongly associate this with links.

If contextual links are not underlined, you can improve link discovery by adding visualisations (such as a colour change or underlining) when the cursor hovers over the link.

A link title creates a small pop-up (such as the name of the site being linked to) when the cursor hovers over the link. These should be used sparingly, but can be useful when the target of the link may be difficult to deduce from context or contrary to the user's expectations.
