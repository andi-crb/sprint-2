I found this article interesting in that it defined social capital rather differently to how I've previously seen it understood. I generally understand it in terms of using connections, and often being quite class based ("I went to expensive-school with a lot of lawyers, son, I'll call them up and get you a job"). This article describes a more inclusive idea of the concept, and one which focuses more on collective than individual benefits, involving building connections with those you work with and getting to know both their area and the background they come from.

Trust is very important to me, though it obviously takes different forms in different contexts and with different people. I confess to some unease with the level of focus on empathy, however - it's certainly important in some situations, but defaulting to it can be intrusive, reinforce problematic social dynamics (for example, marginalised people are often required to show high amounts of empathy with dominant social groups, and put a great deal of energy into doing so, without it being effectively reciprocated) and lead to making assumptions about other people's experiences. So while empathy can be the correct response/tool, in a lot of situations I would primarily value respectful listening to and belief in what other people are saying about their experience.
